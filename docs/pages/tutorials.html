<p>This tutorial walks you through the steps to create your private class
repository.  If you have already created <code>git</code> repositories on GitHub, then
there is nothing new to learn in this tutorial and you should be familiar with
the process already.</p>
<p><strong>A note on <a href="https://code.harvard.edu/">https://code.harvard.edu/</a>:</strong> this is an instance of a <a href="https://github.com/enterprise">GitHub
Enterprise</a> edition hosted by Harvard University.
The user interface is identical to the public <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>
site.  The main difference is that <a href="https://code.harvard.edu/">https://code.harvard.edu/</a> <em>is owned by
Harvard University</em>, whereas GitHub belongs to Microsoft which gives rise to
security concerns regarding data belonging to classes held at Harvard
University.</p>
<h3><a id="tutorial-repo-steps"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#tutorial-repo-steps">Steps to Setup Your Private Class Repository</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Obtain your Harvard

<li>Each day, in the afternoon, the members of the organization will be updated.</li>
<li>If the daily update happened and you cannot access the organization, please fill <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1TxncfkQD0EFG32qalEpsRYWcnoONKOfw6ThyAtsfmy0">this form</a>. You  must use our <code>*.harvard.edu</code> email.</li>
<li>Once added to the organization, navigate to <a href="https://code.harvard.edu/AM215">https://code.harvard.edu/AM215</a>
   (login if necessary) and click the green "New" button to add a new
   repository.</li>
<li>Your repository <strong><em>must be named after your NetID</em></strong>.  You can add an
   optional description if you like.  Make sure the <em>private</em> radio button is
   checked and click "Create repository".  You do not need to check any other
   options.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is all you have to do for now.  In the first homework we will focus on how
to setup your new repository such that you can work with it from your laptop
(you can skip the landing page after you have created the repository). When you
navigate back to <a href="https://code.harvard.edu/AM215">https://code.harvard.edu/AM215</a> you should see something
similar to this:</p>

<p>In order to access content on <a href="https://code.harvard.edu">https://code.harvard.edu</a> using Git you need to
setup an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">SSH</a> key.  Check if you

<!-- Homework {{{1 -->
<!-- 
## <a id="tutorial-hw"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#tutorial-hw">Homework Workflow</a>

The following are the basic rules we apply for homework submissions:

1. **Naming convention for homework directories:** your private repository
   should contain one `homework` directory on the repository root with `hwX`
   sub-directories for each homework assignment.  The `X` in `hwX` is to be
   replaced with the assignment number.  For example `hw1`, `hw2` and so on.
2. **Which files will be considered for grading:** within the sub-directory
   `hwX`, place the assignment files that you want us to grade in a directory
   called `submission`. _We will only grade data in these directories_.
3. **Pull request (PR):** your homework assignments must be completed on `git`
   branches called `hwX`, where `X` is again to be substituted with the
   assignment number.  _Your homework `X` submission requires an open pull
   request to merge the `hwX` branch into your `main` (or deprecated `master`)
   branch for full points_ (both branches are inside your private class
   repository in the [CS107 organization](https://code.harvard.edu/CS107)). Some
   implications of this:
       + Solving homework on the `main` or `master` branch is always wrong.
       + For each homework submission you need to issue _one open_ PR.  _Merging
         an open PR **before** the teaching staff has reviewed and graded your
         work will make the PR disappear_.
       + Only files inside `submission` in PR `X` will contribute to your `hwX`
         grade (see next item).
4. **Gradescope:** your homework will be graded on the [Gradescope
   platform](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/108118/external_tools/89451?display=borderless)
   that has been setup and linked to the class canvas page.  The platform does
   currently not support submission directly via your Git repository.  You
   therefore have to create a `zip` archive of your `submission` directory
   created in step 2 above and upload the archive on
   [Gradescope](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/108118/external_tools/89451?display=borderless).
   It is important that you zip-up the *directory* and not individual files
   inside.  You can use the command `zip -r submission.zip submission/`, where
   the `-r` option means add files *recursively*, `submission.zip` is the name
   of zip archive and `submission` is your homework submission directory from
   step 2 containing your solution.  This assumes you are in `homework/hwX`
   inside your Git repository.

_Points will be lost if any of these requirements are violated_.

> The teaching staff will review the open PR for each homework and grade your
> work accordingly.  Grades will be released on canvas and feedback is provided
> through the Gradescope platform.  Once you have received the grade and
> feedback, your open PR for homework `X` can be merged into your `main` or
> `master` branch if there are no more pending issues.  After the PR is closed,
> you may delete the `hwX` branch in your repository.  This concludes a homework
> submission.


### <a id="tutorial-hw-example"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#tutorial-hw-example">Example Homework Workflow</a>

This example is intended to help you internalize the three basic rules described
above.  _Each homework awards 10 points by performing these steps correctly._

> **Note:** Specific instructions provided in each homework assignment may
> override the following basic approach.

Suppose we want to work on homework assignment 3, which consists of 4 problems.

#### <a id="tutorial-hw-example1"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#tutorial-hw-example1">Step 1: Branch Off</a>

The ease of _branching_ is the main strength of `git`.  Branches allow you to be
destructive without affecting production code or data.  The reason we solve
homeworks on individual branches is to help you develop a feel for this
protection and to materialize the required steps to create branches.  Branches
_will_ provide you true comfort when working on real projects outside of this
class.

1. Make sure your `master` or `main` branch is in the state you want your new
   branch to be based on.  If you need to synchronize with your default remote
   branch you can type

        git pull

2. The next step consists of creating and switching to a new branch that is
   based off the current branch.  For this you can use

        git checkout -b hw3
   which is how you did it before `git 2.23.0`.  Since the `checkout` command is
   [ambiguous](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/RelNotes/2.23.0.txt#L61), the preferred way for more recent versions of `git` is

        git switch -c hw3

You are now on a new branch called `hw3` as required.  You will need to issue a
pull request into `main` or `master` from this branch such that your homework
will be graded.  You can create the PR now (see below) or once you are done with
solving `hw3`, it does not matter to `git`.  (Pull requests are not something
designed by `git` itself, but rather by platforms like GitHub or GitLab.)

> **Note:** you will lose 5 points if you are not solving your `hwX` (in this
> example it is `hw3`) on a branch named `hwX`.  You are of course free to
> create additional branches besides `hwX` if suitable.


#### <a id="tutorial-hw-example2"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#tutorial-hw-example2">Step 2: Solving the Homework</a>

The files the teaching staff will consider for grading have to be located in the
directory `homework/hw3/submission`.  You are free to put other files below
`homework/hw3` that might be useful when you revisit your work sometime later.
The problem sheet might be one of those files.  Class handouts are distributed
in the `main` [class repository](https://code.harvard.edu/CS107/main).  You can
manually create these directories and copy the files you want into your `hw3`
directory using, for example:

        mkdir -p homework/hw3/submission
        cp <path to main class repo>/homework/hw3/hw3.pdf homework/hw3

Alternatively you can use `git` by configuring the `main` class repository as
another remote in your local `git` repository (see homework 1).  In this case
you can checkout all the distributed homework files at once with

        git checkout class/master -- homework/hw3

assuming that the remote points to <https://code.harvard.edu/CS107/main> and is
locally named "`class`".  You may need to update your refs with `git fetch --all`
before you invoke the checkout command above.

The homework sheet will state what files have to be submitted.  For this `hw3`
we assume they are `P1.py`, `P2.py`, `P3.py` and `P4.py`, one for each of the
four problems.

> These files should run and return the required output.  They have to be
> submitted inside the `homework/hw3/submission` directory.

You should commit your work often in logical chunks.  Your commits are to be
done on the `hw3` branch, of course.  The following are a few commands that
might be helpful:

* Use `git status` often to check your local state.
* Use the `git add <file_name>` command to stage files you have changed for a
  commit.
* Use `git commit -m <commit message>` to create a commit with an appropriate
  commit message.
* Use `git stash` to temporarily stash modified files (similar to a commit but
  it is not written to the history).  Later on use `git stash list` to list all
  your stashed changes if you have used `git stash` multiple times.  You can
  check what will change when you apply the stash with `git stash show -p` and 
  apply the stashed changes with `git stash apply` (or
  `git stash pop` which also *removes* the stash from the list).  Note that
  these commands work on the first stash object in the list `stash@{0}` if you
  do not explicitly specify the stash object you want to apply.
* Use `git push` to push local branch/commits to your remote repository.
* Use `git restore <file_path>` to undo changes to a single file.
* Use `git revert <commit_SHA>` to undo the changes in a specific commit.

> Make sure you have committed your solution you want to submit inside the
> `homework/hw3/submission` directory with the required file names.


#### <a id="tutorial-hw-example3"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#tutorial-hw-example3">Step 3: Create a Pull Request</a>

If you have local commits not pushed to the remote issue the `git push` command.
You are now ready to issue a pull request (you could also have done this step at
the very beginning of solving this homework, this is up to you).

The goal is to merge the `hw3` branch into your `main` or `master` branch
eventually.  The teaching staff must review and grade your work first, however.
There are two ways to accomplish a PR on GitHub:

1. Through the web browser at `https://code.harvard.edu/CS107/<your NetID>`.
2. Through the GitHub [command line client](https://cli.github.com/). This
   method is helpful if you get distracted from the context switch that is
   associated with the first method.

> **Note:** you will lose 2 points if you do not create a PR.

**Disclaimer:** you would not typically issue a PR for projects you are the sole
contributor. Pull requests are typical for large projects at a company in which
someone else will review your code before you can merge your code to the
production branch. We want you to become accustomed to this type of workflow. It
is a good idea to always use separate development branches. You should never
commit straight to your `main` or `master` branches until the changes have
thoroughly been tested.


##### <a id="tutorial-hw-example3-webpr"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#tutorial-hw-example3-webpr">Creating a Web Pull Request</a>

1. Navigate to your `https://code.harvard.edu/CS107/<your NetID>` private class
   repository and click on the "Pull Requests" tab in the top left part of the
   window.
2. Click on the "New pull request" button
3. Choose your `main` or `master` branch as the _base_ (the one you want to
   merge into) and your `hw3` branch as the one you want to _compare_ to.
4. This should automatically reload the page and show the changes that will be
   applied.  Click on the "Create pull request" button.
   ![Create PR]({static}/pages/media/create_pr.png)
5. You can optionally add comments to this pull request if you desire.  Click on
   the "Create pull request" button once more to create and _open_ the pull
   request.
6. The pull request is now open.  You can even push more commits to the `hw3`
   branch if you need to correct something (before the deadline has passed of
   course).  Therefore, you could also create the PR at the beginning of the
   homework.
   ![Open PR]({static}/pages/media/open_pr.png)

> **Note:** DO NOT click on the button that says "Merge pull request" until
> you have received your grade and feedback for that homework.  You will lose 3
> points if you prematurely merge your PR.

#### <a id="tutorial-hw-example4"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#tutorial-hw-example4">Step 4: Submit on Gradescope</a>

Your submission is now ready to be submitted for grading on
[Gradescope](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/108118/external_tools/89451?display=borderless).
Simply create a `zip` archive of your `submission` directory you have created in
your Git repository, e.g. `submission.zip`, and upload it to Gradescope by
following the link above. You can use the command `zip -r submission.zip
submission/`, where the `-r` option means add files *recursively*,
`submission.zip` is the name of zip archive and `submission` is your homework
submission directory.

Since you track the change history of your work in
Git, you should not add `*.zip` files to your Git history.  You can simply
ignore such archives by adding the line

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>*.zip
</code></pre></div>


to your `.gitignore` file in your repository root.

<!-- Pair-Programming {{{1 -->
<h2><a id="tutorial-pp"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#tutorial-pp">Pair-programming Workflow</a></h2>
<p>Exercises performed during pair-programming sections should be put under version
control similar to homework assignments (see the <a href="#tutorial-hw">Homework
Workflow</a> section above).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You must not branch off and create a pull-request for pair-programming
exercises</em>.  Just add and commit your work on the <code>main</code> or <code>master</code> branch
and push them to your repository (<em>make sure you are on the correct branch
before you commit!</em>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following are the basic rules we apply for pair-programming submissions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your private repository should contain a directory named <code>lab</code> with
   sub-directories for each session. The sub-directories should be named <code>ppX</code>
   where <code>X</code> is the session number.</li>
<li>Within the sub-directory <code>ppX</code>, place the exercise files that you completed
   during the pair-programming sections. The exercises must have the name
   <code>exercise_Y.ext</code> where <code>Y</code> corresponds to the exercise number and <code>ext</code> is
   the proper extension (<code>.py</code>, <code>.sh</code>, <code>.c</code>, <code>.cpp</code>) depending on the exercise.
   Here is an example how it may look like:
   <img alt="pp files" src="../pages/media/pp_files.png"></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The pair-programming exercises will be graded for <a href="./syllabus.html#pp-submission">completeness</a> and help us ensure you
are on the right track.  You may lose points for the completeness part if you
do not follow these two basic rules.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a id="tutorial-pp-protocol"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#tutorial-pp-protocol">Protocol</a></h3>
<p>In class we are focusing on command line tools for the development of software
projects in computational science.  It is important that you get familiar with a
small selection of such tools and integrate them in your development process.
The pair-programming sections aim at combining some of these tools together to
provide you with hands-on experience while developing software.  The key is the
"pair" in pair-programming.  The exchange of knowledge between team mates in
these pair-programming sections is essential for learning said tools or learning
something new you did not know before.</p>
<p>The pair-programming works by using a tool called <a href="https://tmate.io/"><code>tmate</code></a>
which is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux"><code>tmux</code> terminal
multiplexer</a>.  It allows for easy sharing of
a command line session or a specific instance of a program in read/write and
read-only modes via <code>ssh</code> or web browsers.  Check out this <a href="https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/remote-pair-programming-with-tmux/">blog

more. Text file editing will be performed in any text editor that supports a
text-based user interface (TUI).  Recommended choices are <code>vim</code> or <code>emacs</code>.</p>
<p>If you are mainly working on a Windows operating system, you should install the
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about">Windows Subsystem for
Linux</a>.  A small guide for
doing so can be found <a href="../pages/media/linux_subsystem.pdf">here</a>.  See the
<a href="./tutorials.html#tutorial-pp-tmate">How to Launch <code>tmate</code></a> section below for
the steps to launch <code>tmate</code> on your laptop.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <code>tmate</code> is perfect for any coding related communication.  For
example, debugging, work on the project and of course pair-programming.  There
is no audio channel integrated in <code>tmate</code>.  If students are remote, a zoom
session or similar must be established for oral communication.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The exercises in the pair-programming sections are necessarily collaborative.
Each member of the group will turn in the same script.  Adhere to the following
<em>workflow</em> when solving pair-programming exercises:</p>
<ul>
<li>For each exercise (or sub-exercise for big problems), there will be one
  <em>sharer</em>, one <em>coder</em>, and one <em>listener</em>. <strong>This assumes a group size of 3</strong>.
  If the group only has two people, then either one of you can take the sharer's
  role.</li>
<li>The <em>sharer</em> will start each coding session and document interactions
  including points of contention and challenges. The <em>coder</em> will be in charge
  of writing the code. The <em>listener</em> will make suggestions and may offer tweaks
  from time to time.</li>
<li>The <em>sharer</em> starts a new <code>tmate</code> session and invites the other team mates to
  join the session.  Ideally you want to start the session inside the directory
  of the current pair-programming exercise in your <code>git</code> repository.  You may
  share a read/write link either through <code>ssh</code> or a web browser.<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the sharer allows the others access to her/his computer. Any
abusive behavior that may cause harm on the sharer's system will not be
tolerated and are forwarded to the dean's office.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>After the team mates have accepted the invite, they will be able to share the
  terminal instance and can create new files or execute Python together.</li>
<li>The team should discuss a strategy on how to approach the exercise.</li>
<li>The <em>coder</em> should start writing some code with input from the other two team
  members.</li>
<li><em>Before each section that you work on, place a comment indicating which team
  member worked on that section.</em>  For example, a <code>bash</code> script could look like
  this:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="ch">#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>
<span class="c1"># File       : exercise_1.sh</span>
<span class="c1"># Created    : Sat Aug 07 2021 04:58:49 PM (-0400)</span>
<span class="c1"># Coder      : Alice</span>
<span class="c1"># Listener   : Bob</span>
<span class="c1"># Sharer     : Alice</span>

<span class="nb">echo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;Hello World&#39;</span>

<span class="c1">### Main point of contention: whether to capitalize &quot;W&quot; in &quot;world&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<ul>
<li>For small exercises, each team member can play a single role once.</li>
<li>For large exercises, the team members may rotate roles. The exercise will make
  it clear when you should rotate.</li>
<li>At the end of the exercise, the developed code is inside the sharer's <code>git</code>
  repository that can readily be committed.  Links to download these files can
  be shared with the other team mates such that they can update their
  repositories as well.  Note that the exercise code will contain comments
  pertaining to who worked on which section.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <a href="https://tmate.io/"><code>tmate</code></a> is a tool to <em>share</em> a terminal
session and interact with other people.  If you host a session, it means the
instance runs on your local computer and <em>you are in control</em> of how much
permissions you want assign to your mates.  There are 2 ways to share a
session:</p>
<ol>
<li>read-only: mates that connect to your session can only <em>read</em> data (this is
   safe provided the data you expose is safe).</li>
<li>read-write: mates that connect to your session can <em>read</em> <strong>and</strong> <em>write</em>
   data.  This is unsafe if you share a session with an mistrusted person.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h4><a id="tutorial-pp-tmate1"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#tutorial-pp-tmate1">Recommended Workflow</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>Launch the <a href="./resources.html#docker">CS107/AC207 docker
   container</a> with the working directory mounted (see the provided
   <a href="https://code.harvard.edu/CS107/main/blob/master/docker/run_cs107_docker.sh"><code>run_cs107_docker.sh</code> launch
   script</a>)</li>
<li>Start <code>tmate</code> inside the docker container</li>
</ol>
<p>Wrapping <code>tmate</code> in a docker container provides another layer of security.  You
can also install <code>tmate</code> using your distribution package manager (on Linux or
<a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> on MacOSX) and skip step 1 if you wish not to use a
container.</p>
<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Assume Docker is installed and we have pulled the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/iacs/cs107_ubuntu/tags">CS107/AC207 docker
  image</a>.  You can install the
  <a href="https://code.harvard.edu/CS107/main/blob/master/docker/run_cs107_docker.sh"><code>run_cs107_docker.sh</code> launch
  script</a>
  in your <code>PATH</code> for convenience (e.g. <code>~/bin/run_cs107_docker.sh</code> and add this
  directory to your <code>PATH</code> environment variable).  Be sure that the
  <code>run_cs107_docker.sh</code> script is <em>executable</em>.  See the <code>chmod</code> command to
  change the permissions of the script.</li>
<li>Assume you want to work on the <a href="https://code.harvard.edu/CS107/main/tree/master/lab/pp1">PP1
  exercise</a> and you are
  in the <code>lab</code> directory of your private Git repo and <code>pp1</code> exists.  Launch the
  docker container and mount the <code>pp1</code> directory in your repository:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>run_cs107_docker.sh<span class="w"> </span>pp1/
root@0a076feb425f:~#
</code></pre></div>

<ul>
<li>You are now inside a running docker container.  Note that the hostname
  <code>0a076feb425f</code> is arbitrary and yours will differ.
  Launch <code>tmate</code> (it is already installed in the container):</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>root@0a076feb425f:~#<span class="w"> </span>tmate

</code></pre></div>

<ul>
<li>The <code>tmate</code> instance is now running and you can choose between 4 possible
  links to share with your mates: 2 that can be run in your web browser and
  another 2 to be used with <code>ssh</code> in your terminal (either read-only and
  read/write).  Choose the appropriate link you want to share with your
  pair-programming mates.</li>
<li>If you press <code>q</code> or <code>ctrl-c</code> you are dropped back to the shell.  The server
  will tell you whenever mates join.  You can print the links again with <code>tmate
  show-messages</code> (be careful when you are sharing screens on zoom for example).</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong> that pressing <code>ctrl-d</code> or
  typing <code>exit</code> in the shell will close the active terminal and if only one is
  left, also the active <code>tmate</code> session.  This will close the connections to all
  connected clients.<br>
  You can now work together on the exercise.  For example:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>root@0a076feb425f:~#<span class="w"> </span>vim<span class="w"> </span>exercise_1.py
</code></pre></div>

<ul>
<li>The image below shows a terminal session (left) and two mates connected in a
  web browser window (right):
  <img alt="pp tmate" src="../pages/media/pp_tmate.png"></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We run <code>tmate</code> with <code>root</code> in the docker container.  Do not run
<code>tmate</code> as root in any other situation (even here we could create a regular
user) and be careful with password-less <code>sudo</code> (avoid password-less <code>sudo</code> in
the first place).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to use <code>ssh</code> you need to setup an <code>ssh</code> key if you have not done so
already.  If you do not have such a key, you may create one by running</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>ssh-keygen<span class="w"> </span>-t<span class="w"> </span>rsa<span class="w"> </span>-b<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">4096</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you are not dropped into a shell after you execute <code>tmate</code> it may be because
you are using a shell different than <code>zsh</code>.  Install <code>zsh</code> on your system using
your package manager and run <code>tmate</code> like this</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nv">SHELL</span><span class="o">=</span>/bin/zsh<span class="w"> </span>tmate
</code></pre></div>
